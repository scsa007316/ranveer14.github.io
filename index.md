## About me
Hi! I am Ranveer Kumar Singh. I am a mathematician by training and a theoretical physicist by practice. My research interests include number theory, automorphic forms and string theory. To be precise, I am interested in the underpinnings of string theory and pure mathematics. To discover more about my academic interests, please go to [Research](https://ranveer14.github.io/research/). I am mainly driven by my desire to comprehend the truth of existence which manifests itself in the language of mathematics and physics although not limited to it. This aroused my interest in philosophies of the east and the west. I have been influenced by the western philosophical giants like Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schoepenhaur, Soren Kierkagaard, Sigmund Freud and many others. Eastern philosophy has also imprinted its mark on my thinking, most notably the ideas of Vedanta as expounded by Adi Shankara, Vivekananda and Ramanna Maharshi, Buddhism in the spirit of S.N. Goenka. I have also been exposed to other eastern philosophies as well like Taoism, Zen and so on.
